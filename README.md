<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>
Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

I am an AI & Data Science Master's student at Chalmers University of Technology with a strong focus on building trustworthy, safety-critical machine learning pipelines. 

My engineering journey is driven by practical, high-impact applications. Currently, I am a researcher at the BCN-AIM lab, building robust breast cancer classification models (using Vision Transformers) for the EU-funded RadioVal and EuCanImage consortia. Previously, I shipped production C++ code to optimize high-speed manufacturing algorithms at Deep Detection. 

Feel free to explore my repositories. If you'd like to collaborate or discuss the future of safe, sustainable AI, let's connect!
